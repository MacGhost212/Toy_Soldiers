List of missing elements/ bugs.

Enemy doesnt damage the player nor can he shoot at the player.
A gernade script was written and works but the explosion effect keeps repeating on a loop.
A medkit pick up was added up i didnt get the code right. wouldnt add to player health.
when the gun fires, particles can be seen but are on a loop even after when the gun stops shooting.

One of the assests i used was a paid asset "the ww2 heavy wapons pack", all scripts and animation belong to it orginal creator
used it for the level design

Original third person movement is located in the scenes file under Sample Scene

Stuff that does work

Blendtree animations
Rotation based on Horizontal Axis and movment based on Vertical Axis.
Shooting a laser bolt from the players rifle.
Damage to crates and enemies.

Crates turn red after being shot at and evenly disappear when there health is gone.
Crates have an applied force when shot.
Laser will show if it missed the target or hit its target.
All crates have a health bar with them.

Enemy has full movement range on a nav-mesh map.
Enemy is awaren of the player and will chase the player down

Additional 
the scene is self is the additional work i have done for this project 
some of the work is 
A working tank partol script which one of the stuart light tanks moves in a oval partol
used a repeating smoke script to give two destoryed tanks there flame on effect.
A score of the ammount of boxes needed to be destoryed.
An objective on the top left of the screen to tell you the mission.
Also added a sight to the camera to see where you are shooting at the targets
